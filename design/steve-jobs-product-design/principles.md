# The Principles

Steve Jobs' product design principles, distilled for practical application.

---

## Principle 1: Question Everything

Most products fail because no one challenges assumptions.

### Default Assumptions to Break

| Assumption | The Question |
|------------|--------------|
| "This is how it's always been done" | Why? |
| "Users expect this" | Do they, or are they just used to it? |
| "We need this feature to compete" | Do we compete on features or experience? |
| "The research says..." | Did we show them something better? |
| "It's industry standard" | Who decided that standard was good? |

### The Think Different Approach

> "Here's to the crazy ones... the ones who see things differently."

Innovation comes from:
- Removing what everyone else accepts
- Combining what no one thought to combine
- Solving problems people didn't know they had
- Making impossible things feel inevitable

---

## Principle 2: Start With Experience

> "You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology."

### The Process

**Wrong order:**
1. What can our technology do?
2. How do we package it?
3. What features can we offer?

**Right order:**
1. What's the ideal experience?
2. How should it feel to use?
3. What technology enables that?

### Experience First Questions

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What does the user want to accomplish? | Core job to be done |
| How should they feel while doing it? | Emotional design target |
| What's the fastest path? | Eliminate unnecessary steps |
| What would surprise and delight? | Exceed expectations |
| What frustrates them elsewhere? | Opportunity to differentiate |

---

## Principle 3: Obsess Over Details

> "Details matter, it's worth waiting to get it right."

### Visible Details

Every pixel, animation, word, and interaction must be intentional.

| Detail | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| Typography | Is it readable, beautiful, consistent? |
| Spacing | Is there rhythm and breathing room? |
| Color | Does it serve meaning or just decoration? |
| Animation | Does it feel natural, not performative? |
| Copy | Is every word necessary and clear? |
| Icons | Are they instantly recognizable? |

### Invisible Details

Quality must go all the way through.

| Detail | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| Error states | Do they help users recover gracefully? |
| Edge cases | Are unusual paths designed, not afterthoughts? |
| Empty states | Do they guide instead of confuse? |
| Loading states | Do they feel intentional? |
| Accessibility | Can everyone use it? |
| Performance | Does it feel instant? |

### The Test

> "When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back."

Would you be proud if users saw the code? The error states? The edge cases?

## Principle 4: Say No to Almost Everything

> "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas."

### The Focus Framework

For every feature, ask:

1. **Does it serve the core experience?**
   - If no: Kill it
   - If maybe: Kill it
   - If yes: Keep evaluating

2. **Would removing it hurt significantly?**
   - If no: Kill it
   - If users wouldn't notice: Kill it
   - If yes: Keep evaluating

3. **Is it a "good idea" or a "great idea"?**
   - Good ideas steal resources from great ones
   - Only great ideas survive

4. **Can we do it exceptionally well?**
   - If we can only do it adequately: Kill it
   - Half-done damages the whole product

### What Focus Enables

| With Focus | Without Focus |
|------------|---------------|
| Excellence in core areas | Mediocrity everywhere |
| Clear product identity | Confused positioning |
| Faster development | Endless scope creep |
| Easier decisions | Constant debates |
| User confidence | User confusion |

---

## Principle 5: Own the Entire Stack

Great experiences require integration.

### Why Integration Matters

| Integrated | Fragmented |
|------------|------------|
| Seamless experience | Handoff friction |
| Consistent quality | Inconsistent quality |
| Full control | Dependency on others |
| Faster iteration | Coordination overhead |
| Unified vision | Compromised vision |

### What to Own

Control the pieces that define the experience:
- Core technology
- Key interfaces
- Critical user moments
- Quality-defining components

### When to Partner

Only partner when:
- The component is truly commodity
- Partners share your quality bar
- You maintain control of integration
- Users won't notice the seam

---

## Principle 6: Vision Over Research

> "People don't know what they want until you show it to them."

### Why Research Falls Short

| What Research Reveals | What Research Misses |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Problems with current solutions | Solutions that don't exist yet |
| Preferences among options shown | Options not yet imagined |
| What users say they want | What users actually need |
| Incremental improvements | Breakthrough innovations |

### The Jobs Approach

1. **Understand deeply** — Know users better than they know themselves
2. **Imagine boldly** — What would be magical?
3. **Prototype quickly** — Make the vision tangible
4. **Refine relentlessly** — Iterate until it feels inevitable
5. **Ship courageously** — Trust your taste

### When Research Helps

Research is useful for:
- Understanding current pain points
- Validating that prototypes work
- Discovering unknown contexts
- Testing specific interactions

Research is NOT useful for:
- Deciding what to build
- Prioritizing features by votes
- Validating the vision itself
- Designing by committee

---

## Principle 7: Prototype Relentlessly

> "Real artists ship."

But only when it's ready.

### The Iteration Philosophy

| Stage | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Prototype 1 | Does the concept work at all? |
| Prototype 2 | Does it feel right? |
| Prototype 3 | Is every detail considered? |
| Prototype N | Is it ready to ship? |

### When to Start Over

Sometimes the answer is: restart from scratch.

Signs you need to restart:
- Core concept isn't working
- Accumulated compromises undermine vision
- New insight changes everything
- Can't get it to "feel right"

### Shipping Standard

Ship when:
- A first-time user succeeds immediately
- Details are polished, visible and invisible
- You're proud of every part
- It's better than anything else available

## Summary: The Jobs Checklist

Before any product decision:

| Principle | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Question Everything | Why does this need to exist? |
| Start With Experience | What should this feel like? |
| Obsess Over Details | Is every detail intentional? |
| Say No | Is this essential or just good? |
| Own the Stack | Do we control the experience? |
| Vision Over Research | Are we leading or following? |
| Prototype Relentlessly | Is it ready, or just done? |

If you can't answer confidently, you're not ready to ship.
