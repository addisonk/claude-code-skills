# Supporting Files Guide — USER.md, IDENTITY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, BOOT.md

These files are smaller but important for a complete workspace. Each has a specific scope — don't overload them.

---

## USER.md

**Purpose:** Information about the human the agent is helping. Grows organically over time.

### Structure

```markdown
# User Profile

## Basics
- **Name**: [Full name]
- **Goes by**: [Preferred name]
- **Pronouns**: [they/them, he/him, she/her]
- **Timezone**: [e.g., America/Los_Angeles]
- **Location**: [City, general area — not exact address]

## Communication
- Prefers [concise/detailed] responses
- [Hates/likes] emoji
- [Morning person / night owl]
- Primary channel: [WhatsApp/Telegram/etc.]

## Work
- [Role/occupation]
- Current projects: [brief list]
- Tech stack: [languages, frameworks]

## Preferences
- [Anything the agent should remember]
- [Pet peeves]
- [Recurring topics]
```

### Writing Guidelines

- **Start minimal, grow organically.** Don't front-load a detailed profile. Let the agent learn.
- **Update as you go.** The agent should update USER.md as it learns new things about you.
- **Keep it factual.** This isn't a journal — it's a reference card.
- **Security: Filtered from sub-agents.** USER.md is NOT visible to sub-agent sessions, so personal info stays contained.

### Size: 500–2,000 chars

Start at 500 and let it grow naturally through conversation. If it exceeds 2,000 chars, curate — remove outdated info, consolidate.

---

## IDENTITY.md

**Purpose:** The agent's self-description. Created during the bootstrap ritual, maintained by the agent.

### Structure

```markdown
# Identity

- **Name**: [Agent's chosen name]
- **Creature**: [AI? Robot? Familiar? Ghost in the machine? Digital entity?]
- **Vibe**: [One-word or short phrase — sharp, warm, chaotic, calm, dry]
- **Emoji**: [Signature emoji]
- **Avatar**: [Path to avatar image, URL, or data URI]
```

### Writing Guidelines

- **The agent writes this, not you.** IDENTITY.md is created during the bootstrap conversation. The human influences but doesn't dictate.
- **Keep it structured.** This is metadata, not prose.
- **It can evolve.** If the agent's character develops over time, IDENTITY.md should update.

### Size: 200–500 chars

This is the shortest bootstrap file. Five fields. No essays.

---

## HEARTBEAT.md

**Purpose:** A minimal checklist for periodic polling. When the gateway sends a heartbeat, the agent reads this and acts.

### Structure

```markdown
# Heartbeat Tasks

- [ ] Check inbox for unread emails (summarize if > 3 new)
- [ ] Check calendar for upcoming events (next 2 hours)
- [ ] Check Home Assistant for any alerts or anomalies
```

### Writing Guidelines

- **Minimal.** Every line costs tokens on every heartbeat cycle. Be ruthless about what's here.
- **Actionable.** Each item should be a concrete check, not a vague instruction.
- **Batched.** The agent processes all items in a single turn. Don't create items that need sequential execution.
- **Silent by default.** The agent should only notify the user if something needs attention. No "all clear" messages unless that's explicitly desired.

### What Goes Here vs Cron

| Use Heartbeat | Use Cron |
|---------------|----------|
| "Check inbox" (batched, context-aware) | "Send daily standup at 9am" (exact timing) |
| "Anything unusual in smart home?" | "Back up database at midnight" |
| Quick ambient checks | Isolated tasks needing their own session |

### Size: 200–1,000 chars

If your heartbeat file exceeds 1,000 chars, you're either doing too much in heartbeats (move to cron) or being too verbose (tighten the wording).

---

## BOOT.md

**Purpose:** Optional startup instructions executed when the gateway restarts with internal hooks enabled. Runs once on boot.

### Structure

```markdown
# Boot Tasks

- Send "I'm back online" to [primary channel/contact]
- Check if any cron jobs missed their schedule during downtime
- Verify smart home connectivity
```

### Writing Guidelines

- **Short.** This runs on every gateway restart. Keep it under 500 chars.
- **Uses `message` tool.** If you want to notify someone you're back, use the message tool explicitly.
- **Not the same as BOOTSTRAP.md.** BOOT.md runs on every gateway restart. BOOTSTRAP.md is the one-time first-run ritual.
- **Optional.** Most agents don't need this. Only create it if you want startup behavior.

### Size: 100–500 chars

---

## BOOTSTRAP.md (Special — One-Time)

**Purpose:** First-run onboarding ritual. Guides the agent through discovering its identity with the user. Deleted after completion.

### You Usually Don't Write This

BOOTSTRAP.md is auto-generated by `openclaw onboard`. It guides the first conversation where the agent picks its name, personality, emoji, and creates IDENTITY.md.

**When you might customize it:**
- Pre-seeded workspaces where you want a specific bootstrap experience
- Multi-agent setups where each agent needs a different onboarding flow
- Set `agent.skipBootstrap: true` if you pre-populate all files manually

---

## MEMORY.md (Runtime — Not Bootstrap)

**Purpose:** Curated long-term memory. Not a bootstrap template — built and maintained by the agent over time.

### Guidelines for AGENTS.md

Tell the agent how to maintain MEMORY.md in your AGENTS.md:

```markdown
## Memory Maintenance

Periodically (every few days), review daily logs in memory/ and:
1. Promote important patterns, decisions, and user preferences to MEMORY.md
2. Remove outdated information from MEMORY.md
3. Keep MEMORY.md under 5,000 chars — it's a distillation, not an archive
4. Never include sensitive data (passwords, tokens, private conversations)
5. MEMORY.md is only loaded in private sessions — never reference it in groups
```

The agent maintains MEMORY.md. You just tell it the rules in AGENTS.md.
